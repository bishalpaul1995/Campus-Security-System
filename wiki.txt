- Django-1.8 ( pip )
- mongodb ( apt-get )

- added comments with "mongo updates" in settings.py wherever mongodb related updates made!!
- added comments with "normal updates" in settings.py wherever other changes made!!



I am assuming that mongodb has a database named "CS_system" and it has a collection named "post".
The code in this project is assuming the same thing, so follow along!!
